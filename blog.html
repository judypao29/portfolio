        Summer

        It's finally summertime!
      </p>
      <p>
        It has been a long semester of college, but all this hard work has paid off. It is finally summer, and I get to spend time working on things that
        I enjoy, like making cool projects, music, and going outside to enjoy the warm weather. 
      </p>
      <p>
        So far this summer, I have spent most of my time learning how to make yummy dessert. I made a pudding last week, and it was very delicious. I shared
       the pudding with my parents and my friends, and I think they liked it too. 
      </p>
      <p>
        Next week, my parents are going out on a trip. I get the whole house to myself for 3 days, so I definitely need to start planning what I want to do 
        with the 3 days I have. I might go out and get a bunch of ingredients and make myself some yummy food. Who knows.

        Cactus
      </h1>
      <h4>

      <p>
        My cactus still hasn't sprouted. 
      </p>
      <p>
        I really really want the seed to sprout, but it just won't. I'm still waiting and keeping the soil moist, but nothing seems to be working. Meanwhile, 
        I have grown a very tall green onion. It is growing very tall, and honestly, it's quite cute. 
      </p>
      <p>
        I might just start my own green onion farm. They grow super fast, and they're so easy to plant. Just cut off the white part of the onion and put it in 
        a cup of water, and it'll start growing itself again. 
      </p>
      <p>
        I still really wish my cactus would grow though :(

        Porcupine
      </h1>

      <p>
        I wonder what it's like to be a porcupine. 
      </p>
      <p>
        I would be super spiky and cute, and I won't have to worry about other animals trying to attack me. I'm too spiky for them to attack me. 
        I can hide in the leaves and dig around in the dirt for acorns that the squirrels have buried for the winter, and it would be pretty fun.
      </p>
      <p>
        It would be very hard to cuddle up in a blanket without getting caught in the fluff though. And I probably wouldn't have very many friends 
        because I'm so prickly. No one would want to walk near me because I might accidentally spike them with my quils. 
      </p>
      <p>
        I guess it's good that I'm not a porcupine.
