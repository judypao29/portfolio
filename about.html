        My favorite animal is the lion. Lions cubs are super cute (even cuter when they try to roar!)
        I've liked lions ever since I was little, and they are still a big part of my life today.

              I love planting things. I have been trying to grow a cactus from a seed, but the seeds have not sprouted yet. I'm still waiting for them to sprout one day (hopefully soon).

              I don't have any pets, but I've always wanted to have a cat. Cats are chill and don't require walks 3 times a day. They make nice companions for people that don't like going outside.

              I like to eat fruit. Fruits are really yummy when it's in season. I want to have a garden of fruits in my backyard, but Michigan has 9 months of winter weather every year, so the plants might not be able to survive.
